- Sending an email to [your-email@example.com]
- Using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature (if available)

### 3. Include Details
Please include as much information as possible:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 4. Response Timeline

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use HTTPS in production
- Store sensitive data securely (use environment variables)
- Implement rate limiting
- Use secure session management

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Keep your application updated
- Use HTTPS when accessing the application
- Log out when finished using the application
- Report suspicious activities

### For Deployment
- Use secure hosting environments
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Backup data regularly
- Use SSL/TLS certificates

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Session management is implemented

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper access controls

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting implemented
- CORS properly configured

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Users are encouraged to:
- Subscribe to repository notifications
- Regularly update to the latest version
- Monitor security advisories
